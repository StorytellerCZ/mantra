# Core Components

Here are the core components of Mantra and how they are organized:

## Client-Side Focus

Mantra gives special attention to the **client side** of your app. Mantra does not mix client and server code together; instead, it recommends code sharing. Here are the reasons why:

* Client side is where you put in a lot of effort. It's the biggest part of your codebase. Server-side codebase is relatively simpler to manage and organize.
* In the future, client-side apps will interact with the server using a schema. Client-side apps will have no idea how the server was implemented.
* Mantra [does not believe in Universal Apps](https://medium.com/kadira-voice/say-no-to-isomorphic-apps-b7b7c419c634). It encourages multiple apps for different platforms with code sharing and usage of PWA. Then it's common to have a single server to interact with a few client apps.

Based on the above factors, it's not a good idea to mix client and server code together.

**When we discuss Mantra further in this specification, it will be about the client side of your app.**

However, most of the apps will have server-side components. So, we have a directory layout for the server side as well. For that, refer to [Appendix B](#sec-Appendix-Server-Side-Directory-Layout).

### Server Integration

While Mantra focuses on client-side architecture, it's important to understand how client modules interact with server-side code. The integration happens primarily through two mechanisms:

1. **Meteor Methods** - For real-time data and operations that need to leverage Meteor's reactivity system:
   * Client actions call Meteor Methods using `Meteor.callAsync()` for operations that modify data
   * Results from these calls can update the Minimongo collections, which automatically update the UI
   * This approach is used when working with data that requires real-time updates

2. **Apollo GraphQL** - For more static data or complex queries:
   * Client actions use Apollo Client to execute queries and mutations
   * GraphQL mutations are used for modifying data when working with GraphQL
   * The Apollo cache is updated appropriately based on the response
   * This approach is preferred for data that doesn't require real-time updates

The choice between these two approaches should align with your state management strategy. If you're using Meteor/MiniMongo for a particular data type, use Meteor Methods. If you're using Apollo GraphQL, use GraphQL mutations.

Example of a client action using Meteor Method:

```ts
export const createPost = ({ Meteor, navigate }) => async (title, content, complete) => {
  try {
    const postId = await Meteor.callAsync('posts.create', title, content);
    complete();
    navigate(`/post/${postId}`);
  } catch (error) {
    complete({ [FORM_ERROR]: error.message });
  }
};
```

Example of a client action using GraphQL mutation:

```ts
export const createPost = ({ apolloClient, navigate }) => async (title, content, complete) => {
  try {
    const { data } = await apolloClient.mutate({
      mutation: CREATE_POST_MUTATION,
      variables: { title, content }
    });
    complete();
    navigate(`/post/${data.createPost.id}`);
  } catch (error) {
    complete({ [FORM_ERROR]: error.message });
  }
};
```

This clear separation of concerns allows your client-side code to remain focused while still effectively communicating with the server.

## Modern EcmaScript

We rely on different features of modern EcmaScript/JavaScript and its module system. In order to use Mantra, you need to use at least [Meteor 1.3](https://forums.meteor.com/t/announcing-meteor-1-3-es2015-modules-app-testing-mobile-improvements-and-more/20182), which comes with an implementation of the ES2015 module system, but really you should be using Meteor 3+ and this spec is written expecting you to use at least Meteor 3.0.

## React/Solid as the UI

We use React or Solid as the UI (presentation) layer in Mantra. Both are supported, but you should choose one for your project and stick with it for consistency.

### Choosing Between React and Solid

Both React and Solid use a similar component model and JSX syntax, but they have different approaches to reactivity and rendering:

* **React** - Uses a virtual DOM and re-renders components when state or props change
  * Pros: Larger ecosystem, more libraries, more developers familiar with it
  * Cons: Can be less efficient with frequent updates due to its reconciliation process
  * Best for: Projects where you need a wide range of existing components or where team familiarity is important

* **Solid** - Uses a fine-grained reactivity system without a virtual DOM
  * Pros: Better performance for frequently updating UIs, smaller bundle size
  * Cons: Smaller ecosystem, fewer ready-made components
  * Best for: Performance-critical applications or when starting fresh with a team open to learning a newer framework

Choose the framework that best suits your project's needs and your team's expertise. The principles of Mantra apply equally to both.

### UI Component Principles

Regardless of whether you choose React or Solid, UI components should follow these principles:

* UI components should not know anything about the rest of the app and should not read or modify the application's state
* Data and event handlers used to render the UI component should be passed in via props from containers or passed in as action props from inside event handlers
* It is sometimes necessary to use temporary local state inside a UI component, but that state should never be referenced outside of its own component. UI Components should be pure functions.

When writing your UI components, you can include any other component. Here are some places you can import components:

* Other UI components you define in your app
* UI components from NPM (like material-ui for React or solid-ui-kit for Solid)
* Any Containers in your app (we'll talk about this in a moment)

You can also import any library function and use them in the UI components. You can import them directly from NPM modules, but not from any Meteor packages. These functions should be [pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function).

Here's a simple UI component:

```tsx
import React, { type FC } from 'react';

export const PostList: FC<{ posts: { _id: string; title: string }[] }> = ({posts}) => (
  <div className='postlist'>
    <ul>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <li key={post._id}>
          <a href={`/post/${post._id}`}>{post.title}</a>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </div>
);
```

## Modern Dependency Management

In the original Mantra specification, the Application Context was a central object containing all dependencies and services that components needed. However, with the evolution of modern JavaScript and React, this pattern has become less necessary.

### Moving Beyond Application Context

The Application Context was originally designed to solve dependency injection and avoid direct imports in actions and containers. However, modern JavaScript practices offer better alternatives:

1. **Direct Imports** - For most dependencies, directly importing what you need is cleaner and more explicit:
   ```ts
   // Instead of accessing through context.Collections.Posts
   import { PostsCollection } from '/imports/api/collections';
   ```

2. **React Hooks** - For React components, hooks provide a more elegant way to access shared state and functionality:
   ```tsx
   // Instead of passing apolloClient through context
   import { useQuery } from '@apollo/client';
   ```

3. **React Context API** - For truly global state or services that need to be accessible throughout the component tree:
   ```tsx
   // Create a context
   export const NavigationContext = createContext();
   
   // Use the context in components
   const { navigate } = useContext(NavigationContext);
   ```

For these reasons, we recommend minimizing or eliminating the use of a global Application Context in favor of these more modern approaches.

### When to Use a Minimal Context

If you still need to pass some dependencies to actions (particularly for testing purposes), consider a minimal context with only what cannot be easily imported:

```ts
// A minimal context for actions that need external dependencies
const createContext = (additionalContext = {}) => ({
  // Only include what can't be directly imported
  navigate: (path) => router.navigate(path),
  ...additionalContext // For testing purposes
});
```

This approach makes your code more maintainable and easier to test while aligning with modern JavaScript practices.

## Actions

Actions are where you write the **business logic** in your app. This includes:

* Validations
* State management
* Interacting with remote data sources

In modern Mantra applications, actions can be implemented in two ways:

### 1. Direct Import Approach

With this approach, actions directly import their dependencies:

```ts
import { Meteor } from "meteor/meteor";
import { PostsCollection } from "/imports/api/collections";

export const createPost = async (title, content, complete) => {
  try {
    const postId = await Meteor.callAsync("posts.create", title, content);
    complete();
    return postId;
  } catch (error) {
    complete({ error: error.message });
    throw error;
  }
};
```

### 2. Minimal Context Approach

For cases where dependency injection is needed (especially for testing), you can use a minimal context:

```ts
export const createPost = ({ navigate }) => async (title, content, complete) => {
  try {
    // Import dependencies directly within the function
    const { Meteor } = await import("meteor/meteor");
    const postId = await Meteor.callAsync("posts.create", title, content);
    complete();
    navigate(`/post/${postId}`);
  } catch (error) {
    complete({ error: error.message });
  }
};
```

Both approaches are valid in Mantra. The direct import approach is simpler and more straightforward, while the minimal context approach provides more flexibility for testing and dependency injection.

Regardless of the approach, actions should remain pure business logic and avoid referencing global variables outside of their scope.

Here are some actions:

```ts
import { FORM_ERROR } from 'react-final-form';

export default {
  create: ({ Meteor, navigate }) => async (title, content, complete) => {
    if (!title || !content) {
      complete({ [FORM_ERROR]: 'Title & Content are required!'})
    }
        
    return Meteor.callAsync('posts.create', title, content)
      .catch((error?: Meteor.Error) => {
          if (error) {
            complete({ [FORM_ERROR]: err.message})
          }
        })
      .then((id?: string) => {
          if (id) {
            complete()
            navigate(`/post/${id}`)
          }
        })
  },
};
```

## State Management

In an app, we need to deal with different kinds of states. We can divide them into two different categories:

1. Local State - State in the client-side app that will never be synced with a remote server (errors, validation messages, current page, display option).
2. Remote State - This is the state usually fetched from a remote server and synced with it.

We have different solutions for managing states in our app, including:

* React/Solid state (Local State)
* Meteor/MiniMongo (Remote State)
* Tracker/ReactiveDict (Local State)
* FlowRouter/react-router (Local State)
* Redux (Local State)
* GraphQL (Remote State)

This is where a lot of innovation is happening in the JavaScript community. So, Mantra is flexible when it comes to state management. You can use anything you want.

### Choosing State Management Solutions

Mantra recommends using different state management solutions based on the specific needs of your data:

#### Real-time Data

For data that requires real-time updates and reactivity:

* **Meteor/MiniMongo with Publications/Subscriptions** - Use this when you need data that automatically updates across all clients when it changes on the server (e.g., chat messages, live notifications, collaborative editing).

#### Static or Request-Response Data

For data that doesn't require real-time updates:

* **Apollo GraphQL** - Use this for data that is more static in nature or only needs to be fetched on demand (e.g., user profiles, settings, historical data, or complex queries that don't need real-time updates).

#### Local Application State

For client-side only state:

* **React/Solid state** - For component-specific state that doesn't affect other parts of the application
* **Tracker/ReactiveDict** - For reactive local state that needs to be accessed across multiple components
* **react-router/FlowRouter** - For routing and URL-based state

### Side Effects in State Management

A "side effect" in the context of state management refers to any operation that affects something outside the local scope, such as:

* API calls
* Database operations
* Modifying global variables
* Logging
* Triggering other processes

When we say "React/Solid state can be completely managed in container component if it doesn't have any side effects," we mean that simple state changes that only affect the UI can be handled directly in the container. However, if the state change triggers any of the above operations, it should be managed through an action.

Note: Mantra enforces a few rules when managing your states.

* Any write operations to states should be done inside an action.
* You can read states in both actions and containers.
* You should not read or write into states directly inside UI components. UI components should know nothing about states in your app.
* React/Solid state can be completely managed in container component if it doesn't have any side effects.

## Containers

Containers are the integration layer in Mantra. They perform these actions:

* Fetch and prepare data from various sources (Meteor, GraphQL, etc.)
* Connect UI components with actions
* Handle component-specific state management
* Provide necessary context to child components

In modern Mantra applications, containers leverage hooks and context APIs rather than relying on a global Application Context. This approach aligns with current best practices in React and Solid.

### Container Implementation Principles

When creating containers, follow these principles:

* Use hooks to fetch data and manage state
* Import actions directly and create handler functions that invoke them
* Keep one container component per file
* Pass only the necessary props to UI components

### React Container Example

Here's a modern React container using hooks:

```tsx
import React, { type FC } from "react";
import { useParams, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { useSubscribe, useFind } from "meteor/react-meteor-data";
import { PostList } from "../components/PostList.tsx";
import { Loader } from "/imports/core/components/Loader.tsx";
import { PostsCollection } from "/imports/api/collections/posts";
import { deletePost } from "../actions/posts";

export const PostListContainer: FC = () => {
  const { page } = useParams();
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const isLoading = useSubscribe("posts.list", page);
  const posts = useFind(() => PostsCollection.find());
  
  // Create action handlers
  const handleDelete = (postId: string) => {
    // For actions that need navigation or other non-importable dependencies
    deletePost({ navigate })(postId);
  };
  
  if (isLoading()) return <Loader />;
  
  return <PostList posts={posts} onDelete={handleDelete} />;
};
```

### Solid Container Example

If using Solid, the approach is similar but uses Solid's reactivity system:

```tsx
import { createSignal, type Component } from "solid-js";
import { useParams, useNavigate } from "@solidjs/router";
import { createSubscribe, createFind } from "solid-meteor-data";
import { PostList } from "../components/PostList.tsx";
import { Loader } from "/imports/core/components/Loader.tsx";
import { PostsCollection } from "/imports/api/collections/posts";
import { deletePost } from "../actions/posts";

export const PostListContainer: Component = () => {
  const params = useParams();
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const isLoading = createSubscribe(() => ["posts.list", params.page]);
  const posts = createFind(() => PostsCollection.find());
  
  // Create action handlers
  const handleDelete = (postId: string) => {
    deletePost({ navigate })(postId);
  };
  
  return () => {
    if (isLoading()) return <Loader />;
    return <PostList posts={posts()} onDelete={handleDelete} />;
  };
};
```

This modern approach to containers makes your code more maintainable and easier to test while aligning with current best practices in frontend development.

## Routing & Component Mounting

Note: When we refer to components, we consider both containers and UI components.

For routing in Mantra applications, we recommend using [Flow Router](https://atmospherejs.com/ostrio/flow-router-extra) for both React and Solid applications. This ensures consistency across the Mantra ecosystem and allows the community to focus on shared patterns and solutions regardless of the UI framework used. For mounting components, we recommend using custom mounting utilities that are compatible with modern React and Solid. See [Appendix F: Modern Component Mounting](f.appendix.md) for more details.

The router's primary function in Mantra is to mount components to the UI and manage navigation.

### Routing with Flow Router

Flow Router is a simple and efficient router that works well with both React and Solid:

```tsx
import { FlowRouter } from "meteor/ostrio:flow-router-extra";
import { mount } from "../utils/reactMount"; // For React
// import { mount } from "../utils/solidMount"; // For Solid

import MainLayout from "../layouts/MainLayout";
import PostListContainer from "../containers/PostListContainer";
import PostViewContainer from "../containers/PostViewContainer";
import NotFoundPage from "../components/NotFoundPage";

// Define routes
FlowRouter.route("/", {
  name: "posts.list",
  action() {
    mount(MainLayout, {
      content: <PostListContainer />
    });
  }
});

FlowRouter.route("/post/:id", {
  name: "posts.view",
  action(params) {
    mount(MainLayout, {
      content: <PostViewContainer id={params.id} />
    });
  }
});

// Not found route
FlowRouter.notFound = {
  action() {
    mount(MainLayout, {
      content: <NotFoundPage />
    });
  }
};
```

See [Appendix F: Modern Component Mounting](f.appendix.md) for details on implementing the custom mounting utilities.

### Authorization and Redirection

For handling authorization and conditional redirects, use a combination of FlowRouter triggers and actions:

```tsx
import { FlowRouter } from "meteor/ostrio:flow-router-extra";
import { Meteor } from "meteor/meteor";
import { Session } from "meteor/session";
import { mount } from "../utils/reactMount"; // For React
// import { mount } from "../utils/solidMount"; // For Solid

import MainLayout from "../layouts/MainLayout";
import DashboardContainer from "../containers/DashboardContainer";
import LoginContainer from "../containers/LoginContainer";

// Create a group for protected routes
const protectedRoutes = FlowRouter.group({
  triggersEnter: [checkLoggedIn]
});

// Check if user is logged in
function checkLoggedIn(context, redirect) {
  if (!Meteor.userId()) {
    // Save the intended path for after login
    Session.set("redirectAfterLogin", context.path);
    redirect("/login");
  }
}

// Define protected routes
protectedRoutes.route("/dashboard", {
  name: "dashboard",
  action() {
    mount(MainLayout, {
      content: <DashboardContainer />
    });
  }
});

// Login route with redirect after login
FlowRouter.route("/login", {
  name: "login",
  action() {
    mount(MainLayout, {
      content: <LoginContainer />
    });
  }
});

// After successful login, redirect to the saved path
export const redirectAfterLogin = () => {
  const redirect = Session.get("redirectAfterLogin") || "/";
  Session.set("redirectAfterLogin", null);
  FlowRouter.go(redirect);
};
```

This approach keeps authorization logic separate from the component definitions while providing consistent navigation patterns across your application.


## Libraries

Every app has some utility functions to do different tasks. You can also get them via NPM. These libraries will export functions. So, you can import them anywhere in your app including inside actions, components, and containers.

> When using a library function inside a component, it should be [pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function).

## Code Quality and Formatting

Maintaining consistent code quality and formatting is essential for a maintainable codebase. While not a strict requirement, Mantra strongly recommends using [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting your code.

All code examples in this specification follow the default Biome settings to ensure consistency.

## Testing

Testing is a core part of Mantra. Mantra helps you test every part of your application. The modular architecture and separation of concerns make it easier to write comprehensive tests for different parts of your application.

Mantra follows the [Meteor Guide on testing](https://guide.meteor.com/testing) and best practices for React testing. The testing strategy is divided into several layers:

### Component Testing

UI components should be tested in isolation, mocking any data or functions that would normally come from containers. This approach ensures that UI components are pure and testable.

**Important**: UI component tests should be able to run without the Meteor context, making them faster and more isolated. This reinforces the principle that UI components should be pure and not directly dependent on Meteor.

For component testing, we recommend using:

* [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - For testing React components in a way that resembles how users interact with your app
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - As the test runner and assertion library

Example of a component test:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { PostList } from '../PostList';

describe('PostList', () => {
  it('renders a list of posts', () => {
    // Mock data that would normally come from a container
    const mockPosts = [
      { _id: '1', title: 'First Post' },
      { _id: '2', title: 'Second Post' }
    ];
    
    // Render component with mock data
    render(<PostList posts={mockPosts} />);
    
    // Assert that the component renders correctly
    expect(screen.getByText('First Post')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('Second Post')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Action Testing

Actions contain business logic and should be thoroughly tested. When testing actions, you should mock the application context and any external dependencies.

**Important**: Action tests need to run via `meteor test` or `meteor test --full-app` to have access to the Meteor test database, collections, and other Meteor-specific context. This is necessary because actions often interact with Meteor's methods, collections, and other Meteor-specific APIs.

```ts
import { expect } from 'chai';
import { spy, stub } from 'sinon';
import actions from '../posts';

describe('posts.create', () => {
  it('should call Meteor.callAsync with correct arguments', async () => {
    // Mock context
    const title = 'New Post';
    const content = 'Post content';
    const complete = spy();
    const callAsyncStub = stub().resolves('new-id');
    const navigate = spy();
    
    const context = {
      Meteor: { callAsync: callAsyncStub },
      navigate
    };
    
    // Call the action
    const createAction = actions.create(context);
    await createAction(title, content, complete);
    
    // Assertions
    expect(callAsyncStub.calledWith('posts.create', title, content)).to.be.true;
    expect(complete.calledOnce).to.be.true;
    expect(navigate.calledWith('/post/new-id')).to.be.true;
  });
});
```

### Container Testing

Containers connect UI components with data and actions. When testing containers, focus on testing the data transformation logic and ensuring the correct props are passed to the UI components.

### End-to-End Testing with Cypress

For end-to-end testing, Mantra recommends using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). E2E tests verify that all parts of your application work together correctly from the user's perspective.

Cypress tests should be organized by feature or user flow, and should cover critical paths in your application.

Example of a Cypress test:

```js
describe('Post Management', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup: login and navigate to the posts page
    cy.login('testuser@example.com', 'password');
    cy.visit('/posts');
  });

  it('should create a new post', () => {
    // Click the create post button
    cy.get('[data-test=create-post-button]').click();
    
    // Fill in the form
    cy.get('[data-test=post-title]').type('New Cypress Test Post');
    cy.get('[data-test=post-content]').type('This is a test post created by Cypress');
    cy.get('[data-test=submit-post]').click();
    
    // Verify the post was created
    cy.url().should('include', '/post/');
    cy.get('[data-test=post-title]').should('contain', 'New Cypress Test Post');
  });
});
```

### Visual Testing with Storybook

Mantra recommends using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for visual testing and component development. Storybook allows you to develop UI components in isolation, which is perfectly aligned with Mantra's component architecture.

When creating stories, mock any data or functions that would normally come from containers, similar to component testing.

Example of a Storybook story:

```tsx
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';
import { PostList } from './PostList';

const meta: Meta<typeof PostList> = {
  component: PostList,
  title: 'Components/PostList',
};

export default meta;

type Story = StoryObj<typeof PostList>;

export const Default: Story = {
  args: {
    posts: [
      { _id: '1', title: 'First Post' },
      { _id: '2', title: 'Second Post' },
      { _id: '3', title: 'Third Post' }
    ]
  },
};

export const Empty: Story = {
  args: {
    posts: []
  },
};
```

### Test Coverage

Mantra emphasizes the importance of comprehensive test coverage. The goal is to always strive for full test coverage of your application code. High test coverage helps ensure that changes and refactoring can be done confidently without introducing regressions.

For measuring test coverage in Meteor applications, we recommend using:

* [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) - The most widely used JavaScript code coverage tool
* [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) - The command-line interface for Istanbul

To set up coverage reporting in a Meteor application, you can use the `meteor-coverage` package along with `istanbul`:

```bash
meteor add lmieulet:meteor-coverage meteortesting:mocha
```

Then run your tests with coverage reporting:

```bash
METEOR_PACKAGE_DIRS=../packages TEST_WATCH=1 COVERAGE=1 COVERAGE_OUT_HTML=1 COVERAGE_APP_FOLDER=$PWD/ meteor test --driver-package meteortesting:mocha
```

For component tests that run outside of Meteor, you can use Jest's built-in coverage reporting:

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

Coverage thresholds should be set in your project configuration to maintain high standards. We recommend aiming for:

* Statements: 90%
* Branches: 85%
* Functions: 90%
* Lines: 90%

These thresholds can be adjusted based on project requirements, but the goal should always be to maximize coverage, especially for critical business logic.

By following this comprehensive testing strategy with high coverage goals, Mantra applications can achieve high reliability and maintainability.

## Mantra Modules

Mantra follows a modular architecture. All the components of Mantra should reside inside a module.

You can create as many as modules you like and communicate between them via imports.

### Application Context & Modules

Application context like Intl, user profile of the logged-in user and other should be provided via Context which should be built in the `core` module and put at the top of the router, so it is accessible to all the modules.

### Module Definition

In the past Mantra modules were self-initializing. We are moving away from the magic like approach to be more explicit so it is easier to track where is what coming from. The entry into a module in general should be via a `Router.tsx` in the root of the module that has a default export with the module routes.

> Note: Some modules can have a router that is designed to be a child of another module. For example comments module will have a router that can be included into any place where comments are needed. Into this router will be passed props like content type and content id, so that the module can operate easily. This will make the module re-usable in any parts that requires comments. 

### Implicit Modules

If the module has no actions or routes, or no need to do any initialization, then it's okay to avoid using a definition file or a router. These implicit modules may contain the following:

* UI components
* Containers
* Libraries

### Module Containers & UI Components

Module containers and UI components should be able to be imported via ES2015 modules.

### Module Actions

A module actions can be imported anywhere, but they should be primarily used in the module it was created in.

### Routes

For routing, you can use any routing library. It's okay to have route definitions inside multiple modules if needed.

### Core Module

Mantra is 100% modular and there should be a core in an app. We call this the core module. It's just a simple module. This module is the best place to put:

* core routes,
* application configurations,
* common libraries,
* common actions
* common components

and other application-specific code.

There are multiple ways to organize modules depending on the app. Refer to [Appendix C](#sec-Appendix-Organizing-Modules) for some of those methods.

### Sub Modules

Inside a module, you **cannot** have sub modules. This is a decision made to prevent unnecessary complexity. Otherwise, it's possible to write multiple layers of nested modules, and that's very hard to manage.

## Single Entry Point

With Mantra, we want our app to be predictable. Therefore, there is a single entry point in your app. That's the `client/main.jsx`.

It'll initialize the Application Context and load all the modules in your app. Here's an example `client/main.jsx` file:

```js
import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { AppRouter } from '../imports/modules/core/AppRouter';

'use strict'

if (Meteor.isDevelopment) {
  // debugger
}
