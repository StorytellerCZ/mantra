# Directory Layout

In Mantra, we enforce a common directory structure. That's the core part of the maintainability of any app.

NOTE: In this section, we only discuss the client-side directory layout. To learn about how to organize the server-side directory layout, refer to [Appendix B](#sec-Appendix-Server-Side-Directory-Layout).

## Top-Level Directory Structure

All the Mantra-related code stays inside the `imports` directory of the app. Inside that, there are usually three directories. They are:

```
* api
* configs
* modules
```

Let's have a look at each of these in detail.

### api

This directory contains functionality that is shared with the server such us collections, methods, etc. that is not defined in specific modules. Use this only when you want to share the given methods, etc. with the client side as well. If there is a server specific function it should be in the `server` folder.

You can also use this folder to store app wide helper functions.

### configs

This directory contains root-level configurations in your app. Usually, this is a place to put app-wide configurations which are common to all modules.

### modules

This directory contains one or more modules (in their own directories) in your app. There should be at least a single module, named `core`.

This is what is usually inside a module directory:

```
* actions
* components
* configs
* consts
* containers
* libs
* Router.tsx
* definitions.d.ts
* README.md
```

> In case you have a standalone module or want to include all relevant functionality together for portability then you will also have `api` folder for collections, methods and other relevant code.

Let's learn more about these directories and files.

#### actions

This directory contains all [actions](#sec-Actions) in the module. Here's a sample directory layout inside it:

```
* posts.ts
* index.ts
* tests
    - posts.ts
```

`posts.ts` is a file that exports actions to be consumed by containers. The first function called in containers should pass in application content and other content needed to execute the action. Second chained function is the actual input from the UI component form. 

```js
export const create = ({ Meteor, navigate }) => async (title, content, complete) => {
  // ...
}
```

In the tests directory, we write tests for each action module with its name. Refer to [Appendix D](#sec-Appendix-File-Naming-Conventions) to learn more about test file naming conventions.

#### components

Components contain [UI components](#sec-React-as-the-UI) of the module. It has a directory layout like this:

```
* MainLayout.tsx
* Post.tsx
* tests
  - MainLayout.ts
  - Post.ts
```

Just like in actions, we have a tests directory that contains tests. Refer to [Appendix D](#sec-Appendix-File-Naming-Conventionssec-Appendix-File-Naming-Conventions) for test file naming conventions.

[Click here to see the directory layout for components.](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/tree/master/client/modules/core/components)

#### containers

This directory contains a set of `.tsx` files, with each of them representing a single container.

Here's a common directory layout:

```
* PostData.tsx
* PostListData.tsx
* tests
    - PostData.ts
    - PostListData.ts
```

This directory also has a `tests` directory which contain tests. Refer to [Appendix D](#sec-Appendix-File-Naming-Conventions) for test file naming conventions.

#### conts

This folder includes `.ts` files with constants that are used in the module. All constants should be in capital letters.

```ts

export const PAGE_LIMIT = 10;

export const LICENCENCES = {
  CC_BY: 'Creative Commons',
  COPYRIGHT: 'Copyrighted',
} as const;

```

#### configs

This directory contains the module-level configurations in your app.

> NOTE: Usually, this is where we keep Meteor method stubs which are used for optimistic updates.

#### libs

This directory contains a set of JavaScript files (`.ts` or `.tsx`) which exports a set of utility functions. This is also known as [libraries](#sec-Libraries). You may write tests for libraries inside a subdirectory called `tests`.

#### router.ts

This is the file containing route definitions of the module. It has a default export which is a function. For modules other than `core` and `pages`, routes should be organized using FlowRouter groups.

This is a typical routes definition for the core module:

```ts
import React from 'react';
import { FlowRouter } from 'meteor/ostrio:flow-router-extra';
import { mount } from '../libs/reactMount';

import MainLayout from '../components/MainLayout';

export default function () {
  // Initialize FlowRouter
  FlowRouter.initialize();

  // Define the home route
  FlowRouter.route('/', {
    name: 'home',
    action() {
      mount(MainLayout, { content: { componentName: 'Home' } });
    }
  });
}
```

For other modules, routes should be organized using groups:

```ts
import React from 'react';
import { FlowRouter } from 'meteor/ostrio:flow-router-extra';
import { mount } from '/imports/modules/core/libs/reactMount';

import MainLayout from '/imports/modules/core/components/MainLayout';
import BlogList from '../components/BlogList';
import BlogPost from '../components/BlogPost';

export default function () {
  // Create a group for blog routes
  const blogRoutes = FlowRouter.group({
    prefix: '/blog',
    name: 'blog'
  });

  // Define the blog list route
  blogRoutes.route('/', {
    name: 'blog.list',
    action() {
      mount(MainLayout, {
        content: { componentName: 'BlogList' }
      });
    }
  });

  // For larger modules, routes can be defined in a separate routes.ts file
  // and imported into the router.ts file
}

#### routes.ts

For modules with many routes, you can define routes in a separate file to keep the code organized:

```ts
import { FlowRouter } from 'meteor/ostrio:flow-router-extra';
import { mount } from '/imports/modules/core/libs/reactMount';
import MainLayout from '/imports/modules/core/components/MainLayout';

/**
 * Define routes for a specific group
 * @param group - The FlowRouter group to add routes to
 */
export function definePostRoutes(group) {
  // Define the post view route
  group.route('/:postId', {
    name: 'blog.post',
    action(params) {
      mount(MainLayout, {
        content: { componentName: 'BlogPost', postId: params.postId }
      });
    }
  });

  // Define the post edit route
  group.route('/:postId/edit', {
    name: 'blog.post.edit',
    action(params) {
      mount(MainLayout, {
        content: { componentName: 'BlogPostEdit', postId: params.postId }
      });
    }
  });
}
```
#### api

`api` folder includes additional definitions to be imported by server and in case of collection also re-used by the rest of the module. The typical structure inside the folder looks like this:

```
* collections
* methods
* publications
* resolvers
* schemas
    * graphql
    * simple-schema

```

#### definitions.d.ts

Like in other TypeScript apps and packages, any definition that is not defined directly at the variable will be defined here. For example, we define our collection documents structure in here and then import it through the module where needed. It is also a good place to centralize definitions that are used across many files.
