# Future Work

Mantra is a draft and there will be missing pieces and improvements we can make. We've identified the following features as important to Mantra and they will be available in the near future.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

It's extremely possible to do SSR with Mantra. We are trying to do this in a tool-agnostic manner, but the reference implementation will be based on [FlowRouter SSR](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/tree/ssr).

## Distributing Mantra Modules via NPM

We could distribute Mantra modules via NPM. Once we do that, we could do reuse a lot of code between apps and organizations.

## Standard for Styling

It's better to have a standard for styling UI components.

## Standard for Tests

It's better to have a standard for writing test cases.

## Reusing Data Components

Sometimes, we can use reuse Data Components for the same function in many places. We need to find a pattern for doing that. Maybe hooks?

## Data adapter

In the original vision of Mantra there was a vision of 
Per the [Say No to Universal Apps article](https://medium.com/kadira-voice/say-no-to-isomorphic-apps-b7b7c419c634):

> All the interaction with the server will be done via a mediator on the client side. We should be able to swap it out(if needed) without re-architecting our app. You’ll be able to use Meteor’s LiveQuery, GraphQL, typical REST endpoints or anything you like without re-architecting your app.

This is in essence GraphQL, but with changable ways for the communication layer. We will have to have a discussion to see if we want to pursue this and in what manner. Given that each of the communication options excel at different things and behave differently this sounds more nice than practical at the moment, especially if we want to retrieve certain data in a one manner and other in different one (live vs static).
